 * Pending: This is when a business first submits a template that hasnâ€™t yet been on-boarded and approved.
 * Approved: The template is approved to be sent on our platform.
 * Rejected: The template is rejected to be on-boarded to our platform.
 * Flagged: This is a warned state. When the quality rating reaches a low (red) state, the template is moved to a Flagged status. 
 * 		If the quality rating improves to a high (green) or medium (yellow) state over 7 days, the template returns to an Approved status.
 * Disabled: After a template enters Flagged Status, if the quality rating does not improve within 7 days, 
 * 		the template across all languages will be Disabled. When disabled, a template cannot be edited or used for sending messages.
